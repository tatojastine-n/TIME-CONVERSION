# TIME-CONVERSION
This program changes a time string from 12-hour format (with AM/PM) into 24-hour format. The `timeConversion` function takes the hour and meridian, adjusts the hour based on whether itâ€™s AM or PM, and then recombines it with the minutes and seconds to produce the 24-hour format.
